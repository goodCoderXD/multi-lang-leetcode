# [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/regular-expression-matching/)

Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'` where:

`'.'` Matches any single character.​​​​
`'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

Run `docker compose up <language>` to run the associated test suite.
